			<h3>The Road to Well Being</h3>
			<p>Hello my dearest friends! First of all I would like to explain: why this page? Well, people are asking me in private, details of how to eat, how I eat, why pains, how to handle with them, how I feel, how will they feel if they start a raw and simple life. In this page I will try to explain step by step all these topics, so you will have free access to my informations. I am sure in few years will not be necessary anymore pages like this one, people are more and more interested of a normal and simple life, free of diseases and pains. They will be “forced” to return to nature’s call otherwise- look around you, there is so much suffer and this is just because of stupid thoughts like: “never mind, I don’t suffer”, “my grandma lived 100 years old and she ate of all”, “I don’t eat so much of processed foods”, “I don’t eat meat”, “where do I take my proteins, Calcium, Iron, Vit B12, D, and so on…" No, I don’t need anymore any of this, I am vegetarian from 2008 and raw vegan from 2015. I can speak from my experience, and “I am responsible of what I say, not of what YOU UNDERSTAND”. I just want to share my case, before I became vegetarian, my iron and B12 levels were all the time under the lower limit. Now all my blood tests are perfect.</p>

			<h3>So What is About?</h3>
			<p>Always looking for the magic pill or drug keeps us away from true health. We are sick because we stopped listening to the signals of our bodies, which are the diseases, and fell for the marketed easy-fix-drug.
                
                Our so-called health care system is based on chemicals and surgery, on poisons, removing organs and tissues that are no longer working, replaced by metals and artificial materials. Always looking at the symptoms, finding remedy by suppressing them and not allowing true healing.
                
                We are sick because we gave away our authority, because we forgot that we are sovereign beings, because we lost our quest for true health, and we accepted the labels of disease, we are sick from not daring to step out of the norm, and because we lost our faith in our Creator and in nature." 

                Don't forget that the most important is how you feel about you, how are your passed thoughts; fears, doubts and negativity must disappear from your mind, let it free and smile. Serenity be with you all!
                Many thanks to all my teachers, they know who they are, without them I couldn’t be so strong informed today. All the best from all my heart for all of you!

			<h3>Benefits</h3>
            <p>Keep your body clean for clearance and illuminated conscience and soul. This is what is matter, and not the one moment desire and craving for processed unhealthy foods and bad habits.</p>
            <p>Many thanks to all my teachers, they know themselves who they are, without them I couldn’t be so strong and informed today. All the best from all my heart for all of you! Mireille.</p>
