			<h3>The Road to Well Being</h3>
			<p>Hello my dearest friends! First of all I would like to explain: why this page? Well, people are asking me in private, details of how to eat, how I eat, why pains, how to handle with them, how I feel, how will they feel if they start a raw and simple life. In this page I will try to explain step by step all these topics, so you will have free access to my informations. I am sure in few years will not be necessary anymore pages like this one, people are more and more interested of a normal and simple life, free of diseases and pains. They will be “forced” to return to nature’s call otherwise- look around you, there is so much suffer and this is just because of stupid thoughts like: “never mind, I don’t suffer”, “my grandma lived 100 years old and she ate of all”, “I don’t eat so much of processed foods”, “I don’t eat meat”, “where do I take my proteins, Calcium, Iron, Vit B12, D, and so on…" No, I don’t need anymore any of this, I am vegetarian from 2008 and raw vegan from 2015. I can speak from my experience, and “I am responsible of what I say, not of what YOU UNDERSTAND”. I just want to share my case, before I became vegetarian, my iron and B12 levels were all the time under the lower limit. Now all my blood tests are perfect.</p>
			<p>Please feel free to ask me anything you need to know, in private or on this page. You have also the search option here on my page, put there the word you want to know about and if you don’t find anything of it, just write to me. Please be conscious that if you need some medical terms explanations, "google" them and you will find thousands. I explain from my view, my experience of simple life, full of raw nutrients and not from university researches.</p>
            <p>Many thanks to all my teachers, they know who they are, without them I couldn’t be so strong informed today. All the best from all my heart for all of you! Mireille.</p>

			<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
			<p>"Always looking for the magic pill or drug keeps us in the dark. It keeps us away from true health. We are sick because we stopped listening to our bodies, and fell for the marketed easy-fix-drug.
                
                Our so-called health care system is based on chemicals and surgery, on poisons, removing organs and tissue that is no longer working, replaced by metals. Always looking at the symptoms, finding remedy by suppressing them.
                Not allowing true healing.
                
                We are sick because we gave away our authority,
                We are sick because we forgot that we were sovereign beings, 
                We are sick because we lost our quest for true health,
                We are sick because we accepted the labels of disease,
                We are sick from not daring to step out of the norm, and
                We are sick because we lost our faith in God and nature."
